<!-- ABOUT -->
## 🎮 instadefuse
instadefuse was created and developed by [@eyal282](https://github.com/eyal282), but has now turned into a more inactive resource that sadly isn't being maintained. Hence, why this repository exists. We're here to make sure development of this incredibly useful plugin remains active and fixes are made to existing issues. 

instadefuse is made to make games of retake even faster by allowing counter-terrorists to instantly defuse the bomb depending on different factors. All configurable, of course.

<!-- CVARS -->
## 🚀 Cvars
- ``instadefuse_questionable`` — To prevent players from running for their lives when instadefuse fails, instadefuse won't become active if the time is below the set threshold. (Default: 5.2 seconds)
- ``instadefuse_auto_explode`` — Toggle to make defuses with no chance trigger the bomb explosion instantly. 1 = Enabled. 0 = Disabled. (Default: 0) 
  - Requires ``instadefuse_questionable`` to be ``0.0``.
- ``instadefuse_inferno_duration`` — The active duration of molotovs. (Default: 7 seconds)
- ``instadefuse_inferno_distance`` — The maximum spread distance of molotovs. (Default: 225 yards)
