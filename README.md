Instant Defuse was created by [@eyal282](https://github.com/eyal282) but forked by [@teamorbitone](https://github.com/teamorbitone) to update and maintain it to make sure it meets the expectations of today CS:GO and CS:S server owners. Making sure that the plugin provides the core features that it should be doing even after major updates.
